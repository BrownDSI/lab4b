    "** Introduction **\n",
    "\n",
    "Since Panda's dataframes are essentially tables and Panda's provides easy to use [SQL-like methods](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/comparison_with_sql.html) for manipulating and querying multiple tables, why do we still need databases? \n",
    "\n",
    "Almost all transactional data (that changes over time, and particularly data with records that are updated over time) is stored in databases as opposed to flat files. The reason for this is that databases typically offer persistence, scalability, support for concurrent users and transactions.  For enterprise computing, and other data critical tasks, flat files and ad hoc in-memory schemes simply can't compete with [ACID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACID).  There has been thousands of years worth of development effort put into safely and efficiently handling very large databases led by the relational database community.  More recently [other forms of databases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NoSQL) (such as columnar databases, e.g., [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/nosql-explained)) have also been working on handling this same problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a data scientist in a corporate environment you will typically be expected to be able to form SQL queries to extract data relevant for your research from whatever databases are in use.  Since those databases are designed to enforce various business constraints (e.g., Normal form) they can be quite cumbersome query.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In order to simply the querying process, the star schema introduced in the last lab, in lecture, and also the focus of this lab is often employed by data scientists for data warehouse design.  Here's a nice short [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q77B-G8CA24) about Star Schemas versus Normalized Schema Database systems, and how flattening (which often includes partial de-normalization) to a Star Schema allows for much easier database querying.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objective **\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, you will use SQL statements to create a Star Schema database and then\n",
    "use Python and more SQL to load it with appropriately preprocessed data after.  While doing this you will be become familiar with [SQLite databases](https://www.sqlite.org/about.html) and with using Python's [sqlite3](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sqlite3.html) sqlite interface package.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will also use relational algebra expressions to define some queries.  \n",
